Speaker Conditional WaveRNN: Towards Universal Neural Vocoder for Unseen Speaker and Recording Conditions



Audio samples can be found in [here.](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~dipjyotipaul/Universal-vocoder-IS20)

Baseline Tacotron + WaveRNN that were used in this work, can be found in [here.](https://github.com/dipjyoti92/text-to-speech)


SC-WaveRNN code will be coming soon!!
